    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores how social media sentiment can influence short-term stock market movements. The goal is to analyze whether online opinions from platforms like Reddit and Twitter, or news headlines, can help predict whether a stock index will go up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining sentiment analysis with historical stock price data, this project uses machine learning models to identify any patterns or correlations. It applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of daily news, and then checks if there's a relationship between that sentiment and stock performance.\n"
